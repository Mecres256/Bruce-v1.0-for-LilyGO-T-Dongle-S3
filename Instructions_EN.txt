Bruce v1.0 for LilyGO T-Dongle S3 is a graphical overlay resembling the
Bruce Firmware system, which runs on devices such as M5Stack and LilyGO.

Bruce does NOT run on the LilyGO T-Dongle S3, therefore I created a system
that works on this device.

For the system to work properly, you must first flash the USB Army Knife
software to the LilyGO T-Dongle S3 [included in this folder].

1. Open the "USB Army Knife" folder and follow the instructions provided there.
2. After USB Army Knife is installed, insert the Micro SD card into your computer.
3. Copy the files from the "Bruce" folder to the SD card.
   WARNING! Do NOT copy the "Bruce" folder itself — only the files and folders inside it.
4. Safely remove the SD card from the computer and insert it into the LilyGO T-Dongle S3
   (the slot is hidden inside the USB port).
5. Connect the LilyGO T-Dongle S3 to any power source — computer, power bank, etc.
6. The Bruce-style interface will appear.

=== SYSTEM NAVIGATION ===

1. By default, the "WiFi" option is displayed.
2. To switch between options, press the button.
3. To confirm an option, hold the button for 3 seconds.
4. Each option contains scripts that can be navigated the same way as the main options.
5. To run a script, hold the button for 3 seconds.
6. The available options include scripts that I consider the most basic
   and suitable for learning and experimentation.
7. After launching a script such as "Rickroll" from the "WiFi" option,
   the device will start spamming WiFi networks.

8. To exit an option menu, keep clicking until you reach the "Exit" function.
   The next option will then be displayed.

=== OPTIONS MENU / SCRIPTS MENU ===

1. WiFi
   > Rickroll
   > Deauth
   > Random SSID spam
2. Bluetooth
   > iPhone spam
   > Samsung spam
3. Broadcasting
   > Apple page Evil Portal
4. Utilities
   > Rickroll on Windows [USB]
   > Funny CMD prank [USB]
   > Empty script [REM]
5. Windows
   > Windows Activation (NOT recommended for legal reasons) [USB]
   > Create Admin [USB]
   > Empty script [REM]
6. Android
   > UnlockMyOldPhone – LilyGO T-Dongle S3 connected via USB to an Android phone
     will quickly unlock it (the same PIN must be set in the autorun.ds file*).
   > Empty script [REM]
   > Empty script [REM]

=== CUSTOM COMMANDS ===

To add your own commands, open the autorun.ds file in a text editor
and replace existing scripts (e.g. those responsible for Deauth)
or the sections marked as "REM".

You can also change the names displayed when scripts are executed.

--- HOW IS THIS SYSTEM MADE? ---

This system (Bruce v1.0 for LilyGO T-Dongle S3) is based on Rubber Ducky
and Marauder commands.

The interface is built from separate graphic files.
By editing images in the folders: files, more, select,
you can completely change the appearance of the system.

Folder structure (what is what):

files   – main options menu interface
more    – the same options menu interface, but with dimmed arrows [next]
select  – the same options menu interface, but with dimmed icons [confirm]

autorun.ds – the entire control code for Bruce v1.0 for LilyGO T-Dongle S3

apple.html – fake Apple page used in the "Apple page Evil Portal" script

AUTORUN.INF – simply the name of the SD card

other folders – not related to the system; they contain previously tested
                elements [disabled]. The "test" folder contains the system font.
                Removing it will not cause damage, but keeping it allows
                interface modification using the same font.

programs – scripts stored as separate files (opening them in a text editor
           shows their source code). They can be deleted — the system does not
           depend on them.

>>> WHY IS IT DONE THIS WAY? <<<

I am aware that this could be done much better — optimization would help,
but this is the first of many versions that actually works on this device.

PS: I hope you enjoy using this device in this form :)
